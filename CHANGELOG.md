## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Unified Library View**: See audiobooks from ALL your connected libraries in a single view
  - Library, Home, and Collections screens now aggregate content from all accounts/libraries
  - Search finds audiobooks across all libraries
  - "Recently Listened" and "Recently Added" show books from all libraries
- Automatic changelog generation in GitHub release workflow
- CHANGELOG.md file to track all notable changes to the project

### Changed
- **Progress Reporting to Plex**: Overhauled for accuracy and reliability
  - Migrated `PlexSyncScrobbleWorker` to `CoroutineWorker` for proper async handling
  - Created `PlexProgressReporter` for thread-safe, library-aware Plex API calls
  - Removed `duration × 2` hack — Plex dashboard now shows accurate playback progress
  - Added immediate pause state reporting so Plex "Now Playing" updates immediately (within 500ms)
  - Made `startMediaSession()` library-aware for multi-library setups
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API calls (3 attempts + WorkManager retry)
  - Eliminated race condition when reporting progress for books from different libraries
  - Request-scoped Retrofit instances prevent global state mutation during progress reporting
- **OAuth Login**: Replaced WebView with Chrome Custom Tabs for improved security and social login support
  - Enables Google/Facebook login (blocked in WebViews)
  - Platform set to "Web" instead of "Android" to enable social authentication
  - Deep link redirect (`chronicle://auth/callback`) returns user to app automatically
  - Expedited polling (200ms) after browser return for faster completion
  - New auth components: `PlexAuthCoordinator`, `PlexAuthUrlBuilder`, `PlexAuthState`, `AuthReturnActivity`, `AuthCoordinatorSingleton`
  - Hosted redirector page at `auth.chronicleapp.net` for seamless deep link integration
- Library sync now automatically syncs ALL connected libraries
- Playback progress syncs to the correct Plex server based on the audiobook's library
- Removed library switching options from Settings (no longer needed with unified view)
- Removed "Switch Library" menu from Library and Home screens

### Removed
- "Change Library" preference from Settings
- "Change Server" preference from Settings
- "Change User" preference from Settings
- Library selector menu items

### Fixed
- **Fixed:** Chapters appearing duplicated (2-4x) in audiobook details screen due to auto-generated primary key preventing conflict detection on re-sync — `ChapterRepository.loadChapterData()` now uses delete-before-insert pattern to prevent duplicates
- **Fixed:** Chapter and track metadata failing to load for audiobooks from non-active libraries — `BookRepository`, `TrackRepository`, and `ChapterRepository` now use library-specific server connections via `ServerConnectionResolver` and `ScopedPlexServiceFactory`
- **Fixed:** Only last chapter displayed for multi-chapter audiobooks due to primary key conflict — Chapters now use auto-generated `uid` primary key instead of `id` (ChapterDatabase v1→v2 migration)
- **Fixed:** Chapters missing bookId association — `PlexChapter.toChapter()` now accepts `bookId` parameter and `ChapterRepository.loadChapterData()` correctly associates chapters with their audiobook
- **Fixed:** Thumbnail images returning 404 for non-active library books — Added `PlexConfig.makeThumbUriForLibrary()` for library-aware thumbnail URL resolution
- Fixed Plex "Now Playing" dashboard not showing Chronicle as an active streaming client
  - Aligned scoped interceptor headers in `PlexProgressReporter` to use consistent `X-Plex-Client-Identifier` (UUID) across all API calls
  - Added missing `X-Plex-Session-Identifier` header to timeline updates
  - Captured and cached `playQueueItemID` from `POST /playQueues` response for use in timeline updates
  - Updated network progress reporting frequency to every 30 seconds
- Fixed OAuth login getting stuck in infinite loop when transient network errors occur during PIN polling
  - Network errors (DNS failures, timeouts, connection resets) no longer corrupt the OAuth PIN ID
  - Only HTTP 404 errors (PIN expired/not found) now clear the PIN ID as intended
  - Prevents infinite 404 loop that blocks users from completing login
- Fixed playback failure for audiobooks from secondary libraries in multi-account setups
  - Introduced `ServerConnectionResolver` for library-specific server URL and token resolution
  - Updated `PlaybackUrlResolver` to route requests to the correct Plex server per library
  - Updated `PlexHttpDataSourceFactory` to inject library-specific auth tokens
  - Updated `PlexSyncScrobbleWorker` for library-aware progress scrobbling
  - Added `serverUrl` and `authToken` fields to Library entity (database migration)
- Fixed playback failing for audiobooks from non-active libraries due to incorrect metadata path format and wrong auth token in playback decision API calls
  - `PlaybackUrlResolver` now strips `"plex:"` prefix from metadata paths before API calls (prevents HTTP 400 errors)
  - Playback decision API calls now use library-scoped Retrofit instances with correct auth tokens (following `PlexProgressReporter` pattern)
- Fixed HTTP 401 error on Android Auto cold start due to stale auth tokens in ExoPlayer DataSource
- Fixed server connections accumulating over time - server list now refreshes every 24 hours (every startup in debug builds) and replaces stale connections instead of merging
- Added "Strict Auto client validation" toggle in Settings → ETC (defaults to off) to resolve Google Play Store rejection caused by review tools being blocked by client signature validation
- Fixed `PlexAuthUrlBuilder` to use standard Java URL encoding instead of Android Uri.encode() for unit test compatibility

### Improved (Playback Robustness)

#### Phase 1: Foundation - New Utility Classes
- **ErrorHandling**: `ChronicleError` sealed class for structured error handling with categories (Network, Playback, Data, Authentication, Configuration)
- **RetryHandler**: `withRetry()` function with exponential backoff, configurable max attempts, initial delay, max delay
- **NetworkMonitor**: `NetworkState` sealed class with StateFlow observation for real-time connectivity monitoring
- **ScopedCoroutineManager**: Replaces GlobalScope with proper lifecycle management

#### Phase 2: Thread Safety - State Management
- **PlaybackState**: New immutable data class for playback state with computed properties via `copy()` pattern
- **PlaybackStateController**: Single source of truth for playback state with StateFlow-based reactive state management and debounced database persistence
- **TrackListStateManager**: Added Mutex protection for thread-safe atomic state updates
- **CurrentlyPlayingSingleton**: Now observes PlaybackStateController, bridges StateFlow to LiveData for UI consumption

#### Phase 3: Network Resilience
- **PlaybackUrlResolver**: Thread-safe URL caching, retry logic for URL resolution using exponential backoff
- **PlexConfig**: Connection retry with exponential backoff, reduced initial timeout for faster failover

#### Phase 4: Error Handling
- **CachedFileManager**: Replaced GlobalScope with ScopedCoroutineManager for proper lifecycle management

#### Phase 5: Playback Service
- **SeekHandler**: New component for atomic seek operations with timeout, prevents seek race conditions
- **ChapterValidator**: New component that validates positions against chapter bounds, prevents invalid chapter transitions
- **CurrentlyPlayingBindingAdapters**: Safe valueTo adapter for Slider to prevent crash with 0 duration

#### Phase 6: Android Auto
- **MediaPlayerService**: Enhanced error handling with `[AndroidAuto]` log tags
- **AudiobookMediaSessionCallback**: MediaSession state sync with PlaybackStateController, defensive null checks in browse tree operations

### Documentation
- Updated architecture documentation with new state management patterns
- Added PlaybackStateController, retry with exponential backoff, and error handling patterns to patterns.md
- Updated playback feature documentation with thread safety and error handling details
- Enhanced Android Auto documentation with error handling and state sync details
- Updated AGENT.md with new components and patterns
