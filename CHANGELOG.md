## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Unified Library View**: See audiobooks from ALL your connected libraries in a single view
  - Library, Home, and Collections screens now aggregate content from all accounts/libraries
  - Search finds audiobooks across all libraries
  - "Recently Listened" and "Recently Added" show books from all libraries
- Automatic changelog generation in GitHub release workflow
- CHANGELOG.md file to track all notable changes to the project

### Changed
- Library sync now automatically syncs ALL connected libraries
- Playback progress syncs to the correct Plex server based on the audiobook's library
- Removed library switching options from Settings (no longer needed with unified view)
- Removed "Switch Library" menu from Library and Home screens

### Removed
- "Change Library" preference from Settings
- "Change Server" preference from Settings
- "Change User" preference from Settings
- Library selector menu items

### Fixed
- Fixed HTTP 401 error on Android Auto cold start due to stale auth tokens in ExoPlayer DataSource
- Fixed server connections accumulating over time - server list now refreshes every 24 hours (every startup in debug builds) and replaces stale connections instead of merging
- Added "Strict Auto client validation" toggle in Settings → ETC (defaults to off) to resolve Google Play Store rejection caused by review tools being blocked by client signature validation

### Improved (Playback Robustness)

#### Phase 1: Foundation - New Utility Classes
- **ErrorHandling**: `ChronicleError` sealed class for structured error handling with categories (Network, Playback, Data, Authentication, Configuration)
- **RetryHandler**: `withRetry()` function with exponential backoff, configurable max attempts, initial delay, max delay
- **NetworkMonitor**: `NetworkState` sealed class with StateFlow observation for real-time connectivity monitoring
- **ScopedCoroutineManager**: Replaces GlobalScope with proper lifecycle management

#### Phase 2: Thread Safety - State Management
- **PlaybackState**: New immutable data class for playback state with computed properties via `copy()` pattern
- **PlaybackStateController**: Single source of truth for playback state with StateFlow-based reactive state management and debounced database persistence
- **TrackListStateManager**: Added Mutex protection for thread-safe atomic state updates
- **CurrentlyPlayingSingleton**: Now observes PlaybackStateController, bridges StateFlow to LiveData for UI consumption

#### Phase 3: Network Resilience
- **PlaybackUrlResolver**: Thread-safe URL caching, retry logic for URL resolution using exponential backoff
- **PlexConfig**: Connection retry with exponential backoff, reduced initial timeout for faster failover

#### Phase 4: Error Handling
- **CachedFileManager**: Replaced GlobalScope with ScopedCoroutineManager for proper lifecycle management

#### Phase 5: Playback Service
- **SeekHandler**: New component for atomic seek operations with timeout, prevents seek race conditions
- **ChapterValidator**: New component that validates positions against chapter bounds, prevents invalid chapter transitions
- **CurrentlyPlayingBindingAdapters**: Safe valueTo adapter for Slider to prevent crash with 0 duration

#### Phase 6: Android Auto
- **MediaPlayerService**: Enhanced error handling with `[AndroidAuto]` log tags
- **AudiobookMediaSessionCallback**: MediaSession state sync with PlaybackStateController, defensive null checks in browse tree operations

### Documentation
- Updated architecture documentation with new state management patterns
- Added PlaybackStateController, retry with exponential backoff, and error handling patterns to patterns.md
- Updated playback feature documentation with thread safety and error handling details
- Enhanced Android Auto documentation with error handling and state sync details
- Updated AGENT.md with new components and patterns
