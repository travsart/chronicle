/**
 * Tests for PlaybackUrlResolver focusing on multi-library playback fixes.
 *
 * **Testing Limitations:**
 * The current implementation creates scoped Retrofit service instances internally
 * via createScopedService(), which makes it difficult to mock HTTP-level behavior
 * in unit tests. These tests focus on observable behaviors:
 * - ServerConnectionResolver integration (library-aware resolution)
 * - Cache behavior and invalidation
 * - Library-specific connection handling
 *
 * **Note on Bug Fix Coverage:**
 * - Bug #1 (plex: prefix stripping): Cannot be directly unit tested without mocking
 *   the internal HTTP calls or using MockWebServer. The fix is verified through
 *   integration/manual testing.
 * - Bug #2 (library-scoped service): CAN be tested by verifying ServerConnectionResolver
 *   is called with correct library IDs.
 *
 * For comprehensive HTTP-level testing, consider:
 * 1. Integration tests with MockWebServer
 * 2. Making service creation injectable for testing
 * 3. Manual/integration testing of actual Plex API calls
